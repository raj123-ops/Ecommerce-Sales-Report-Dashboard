2. Sales Trend (Month-over-Month Comparison)

Year 2021 Sales:

The year began at ₹0.8M–1M in January and saw a peak in March (~₹1M) — possibly driven by seasonal campaigns or promotional events.

A dip occurred from April to June (~₹0.9M), followed by another rise to ₹1M in July.

The rest of the year maintained a steady trend near ₹0.9M, signaling stable performance post-festive peaks.


Year 2022 Sales:

January began stronger at ₹1M, but sales declined through July, fluctuating around ₹0.9M.

August marked recovery, stabilizing back to ₹1M.

November saw the highest peak (~₹1.1M) — likely due to festive offers like Diwali, Black Friday, or end-of-season sales.

However, December experienced a steep decline to ₹0.7M, potentially due to post-holiday season fatigue.

3. Profit Trend Over Time

Year 2021 Profit:

January started with ₹90K, then dipped to ₹80K in February.

A rise in March (₹100K) was followed by fluctuating profits through mid-year.

October achieved ₹119K, while December closed strong at ₹110K.


Year 2022 Profit:

Mirrored the previous year early on with ₹90K in January, a dip in February, and ₹100K in March.

April jumped to ₹110K, with steady movement between ₹90K–₹110K through September.

Observations:

The spikes in March, July, and October–November across both years suggest the impact of promotional campaigns, festive seasons, or quarter-end incentives.

The profit pattern aligns closely with sales peaks, reinforcing the connection between targeted sales strategies and financial success.

December’s recurring drop in both years might signal reduced buying activity post major sales events — an area where off-season deals or retention strategies could help.
